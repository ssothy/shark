            Movies portray sharks as bloodthirsty
            murder machines that crave human flesh when in my own readings about sharks
            it says that they actually don't even like the taste of humans, they just mistake us
            for seals which is pretty understandable since drunk sailors used to mistake 
            manatees for mermaids. Sharks are kind of like big curious water dogs, the only way
            they can test to see if we're actually a delicious seal is by using their mouth filled
            with razor sharp rows of teeth, but that's not their faults. They were just made kind of
            dangerous. Also there's many very peaceful species of sharks so a lot of other sharks are 
            getting a bad rap just because of some movies like the whale shark.
            Although shark movies are my favorite to watch, I just believe people should be 
            more informed on the facts of the sharks. Sharks are great for our ecosystem and if 
            it wasn't for their ferocious hunting skills our whole ecosystem could be thrown off.
